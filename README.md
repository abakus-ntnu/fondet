This project has two folder structures. This is the backend, and documentation for the client can be seen in the `client` folder.

To start development and run the client and the backend at the same time - Run

$ yarn server
$ yarn client

To start both concurrently, try:
$ npm run dev

If this is your first time running the project, you have to install the NPM packages first. This is done by first.

$ yarn
$ cd client
$ yarn
